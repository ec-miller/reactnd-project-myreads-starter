# MyReads App
### Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program

This app is Project 6 in the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program. In this project we were tasked with taking a static mockup of a website and turning it into an interactive SPA playground using React. Inside the app you can categorize books as "Currently Reading, "Want To Read", or "Read". You can also search for more books to add to the shelves using the plus icon in the lower right of the screen. Caching of your shelves data allows for your selections to be saved even if you navigate away from the page. Enjoy exploring the books!
